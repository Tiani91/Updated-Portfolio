# Updated-Portfolio
<p> This is my updated Portfolio to showcase some work that I have done throughout my learning of frontend coding. </p>
<p> I have built this portfolio from scratch using html, css and javascript. </p>
<p> I hope you enjoy the way it turns out, and I hope it gives you a little bit of "oh i never thought to do it this way" type thoughts. </p>
